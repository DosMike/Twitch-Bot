; Comments start with a semi-colon
; Empty lines are ignored
; Do not use additional spaces

; If it helps reading you can import the Notepad++.xml as User Defined Language file
; Should help you formatting everything

; A line starting with a less (<) marks a trigger
; Triggers are regular expressions - look them up, you can do freaky stuff with those
; Regular expressions are flagged as case-insensitive
; You can test them here http://www.regextester.com/ (or at any other website, there are hundrets)

; The next line is a list of flags for that trigger as plain text, speparated with a comma and a space in order (, )
; This line is optional and may be omitted
; Currently there are the following flags:
; Random - Will pick a random response instead of going through the list in order
; Cooldown:A - Ignore this command for A seconds after the last use
; ClientCooldown:A - Ignore this command for A seconds for a viewer after said viewer used that command
; RankAbove:R - The min rank (rank R exclusive) to use this trigger (Ranks are NONE, FOLLOW,  USER, SUB, MOD, HOST)
; RankMax:R - The max rank (rank R incluseive) to use this trigger (Ranks are NONE, FOLLOW, USER, SUB, MOD, HOST)
; Points - The ammount of points a user hase to spend in order to use a command

; All following lines starting with a greater (>) mark a response
; A response may not contain line breaks - those are not supported by IRC (the software used for Twitch-chat)
; Following expressions are automatically replaced:
; %sender% - the person that triggered the message
; %rng:~A,B% - a random number between (including) A and (including) B
; %curl:~U% - load a message from a given url U. You can use regex groups inside to parameterize the url
; If you catch regex groups you can paste them with the usual $n

; In order to configure a default command use the command name prefixed with an exclamation mark
; followed by the command name instead of the less sign. Example:
; !songrequest
; instead of 
; <songrequest or <!songrequest
; You can still add a chat trigger that uses the same commandname but it will only fire if the
; default command was not fired. This way you can add timeout messages for example:
; !songrequest                 <- Configure the default command
; Cooldown:120                 <- Set cooldown to 2 minutes
; <!songrequest(?:\s.*)            <- Chat trigger for !songrequest - the \s.* means any arguments
; Cooldown:5                   <- This trigger now gets a cooldown of 5 seconds
; >Songrequest is on cooldown  <- And it has one response telling the command is on cooldown

; If you write responses before any input (above all triggers) they'll be put in a cyclic queue to be broadcasted
; one at a time every two minutes. Because they have no arguments they'll also have no replacement capabilities
