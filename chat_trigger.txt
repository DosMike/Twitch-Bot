; Comments start with a semi-colon
; Empty lines are ignored
; Do not use additional spaces

; If it helps reading you can import the Notepad++.xml as User Defined Language file
; Should help you formatting everything

; A line starting with a less (<) marks a trigger
; Triggers are regular expressions - look them up, you can do freaky stuff with those
; Regular expressions are flagged as case-insensitive
; You can test them here http://www.regextester.com/ (or at any other website, there are hundrets)

; The next line is a list of flags for that trigger as plain text, speparated with a comma and a space in order (, )
; This line is optional and may be omitted
; Currently there are the following flags:
; Random - Will pick a random response instead of going through the list in order
; Cooldown:A - Ignore this command for A seconds after the last use
; RankAbove:R - The min rank (rank R exclusive) to use this trigger (Ranks are NONE, USER, SUB, MOD, HOST)
; RankMax:R - The max rank (rank R incluseive) to use this trigger (Ranks are NONE, USER, SUB, MOD, HOST)

; All following lines starting with a greater (>) mark a response
; A response may not contain line breaks - those are not supported by IRC (the software used for Twitch-chat)
; Following expressions are automatically replaced:
; %sender% - the person that triggered the message
; %rng:~A,B% - a random number between (including) A and (including) B
; If you catch regex groups you can paste them with the usual $n

;; Limiting commands the bot comes with
; play shall be "SUB only"
